I had the right idea that you have to select one index and compare its value to the index value next to that element; however, it was poorly executed because we weren't able to stop our algorithm at the right time. In addition to that mistake, there were no **minium variable** and we kept comparing **curr_index**.\n",

    "The main fix here is creating a **current index in the outer while loop** and compare the **minium index** with the **next index**. This allows us to compare the right value where if the *minium index* is lower than the *next index*, we'll set the *minium index* to the *next index*.\n",
