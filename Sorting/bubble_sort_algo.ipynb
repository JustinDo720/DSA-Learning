    "Imagine you have a list of numbers. **Bubble sort** makes multiple passes through the list, comparing pairs of adjacent numbers and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. This repeats until the whole list is sorted, like **bubbles rising to the top**. It's simple but not the fastest for big lists."

The answer was a **nested while loop** that takes into the considering of our iteration over the list rather than seeing if it swapped or not.
